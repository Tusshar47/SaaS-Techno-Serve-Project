 Formulated specific questions for each 5C's element to thoroughly analyse root causes.


**Findings:**
 Pune had the lowest performance, while Mumbai emerged as the top-performing city.
 Enterprise sellers and marketing activities generated the highest sales, surpassing online leads and telesales.
 ERP implementation and Technical Business Solutions were the top revenue generators across all sales brackets.
 Clients with a revenue of $100K or less contributed the most to the company's revenue, followed by clients with $500K to $1M.
